Changes in v1.1.0:
- Updated PaceMan Tracker to v0.3.0
  - Update SpeedRunIGT to v14.1! 
- Some new window settings buttons to optimize for various playstyles (@draconix6 #84)
- Added more option descriptions (@draconix6 #84)
- Removed "Reset All After Playing", it was a verification feature for non wall recorders, which is now no longer needed. (@draconix6 #84)
- Removed other verification warnings because wall recording is no longer required. (@draconix6 #84)
- LAUNCH plugin event (devs might care, you surely don't) (@pants721 #83)
- Added `clearworlds` command
- Various tweaks and fixes

Changes in v1.0.2:
- Updated PaceMan Tracker (a few bug fixes)

Changes in v1.0.1:
- Fix issue for computers using a comma for decimal formatting

Changes in v1.0.0:
- **Added PaceMan.gg support! Access the tracker through the plugins menu.**
- Big changes to the OBS script (restart OBS after updating Julti!):
  - Options that don't affect scene generation have been moved into Julti's options (see the OBS section).
  - Added Multi scene generator into the main script (previously existed as a separate script). This generates a scene per instance so you can do silly transitions and stuff.
  - Added `[Generation Option]` to the start of all generation options in the script, to make it obvious that they only take effect when pressing `Generate Scenes` again.
  - Each instance in the Julti scene will generate with an instance number indicator at 15% opacity.
  - Lock Display being stuck with example instances on should no longer happen.
- Added a "Show Instance Number Indicators" option (found in OBS section). This is added along with all the options moved from the OBS script.
- Added "Active Instance Scaling" for the align active instance option. This is mainly used for when the OBS canvas size does not match the monitor resolution.
- Julti will now output a `currentlocation.txt` file in the `.Julti` folder, which is purely for the current instance number overlay in multi scenes.  
- Standard Manager will now tell Julti to reload instance options whenever you change an option. This means changing Julti-related Minecraft keybinds using Standard Manager will work immediately.
- Updated world clearing. The new conditions for a world to be deleted are:
  - The world name must not start with "_" and must not contain a "Reset Safe.txt" file.
  - The world name match a common speedrun world name (`New World...`, `Random/Set Speedrun #...`, `Practice Seed...`).
  - The world must not be within the last 6 most recently played worlds (6 deletable worlds will be kept).
- The Julti GUI will now show which instance is being played or was last played. (@draconix6 #78)
- Added minimize projector experimental option. (@draconix6 #78)
- Added detection for multiple Julti's to be open. (@draconix6 #78)
- Various fixes and tweaks. (@draconix6 #77)
  - Julti GUI is now forced back in bounds when it launches out of bounds.
  - Coop mode will work a little better when not using bypass.
- Added a "doaction" command which can replicate the exact functionality of hotkeys (the `reset all` command isn't exactly the same as full reset hotkey).
- Added experimental option "Activate Projector On Reset" for bypass + thin BT users. (@draconix6 #79)
- Added some option descriptions.(@draconix6 #79) 
- Added various standard options warnings. (@draconix6 #79)
- Added fullscreen delay experimental option. (@draconix6 #79)
- Updated default scripts to contain a new launch + mega warmup script, and remove the old warmup script and the dragon fight script.
- Added benchmark plugin as a default plugin.
- Updated plugin loading to choose the newest version out of the default plugins and folder plugins.
- Added "Package Files For Submission" option when right-clicking instances in the instances panel. This will collect necessary files for verification from that instance in one place. (@draconix6 #80)

Changes in v0.22.0:
- Added customizable delay between instance launches
- Changed default affinity values
- Added a new button to set affinity values to defaults (recommended)
- Added freeze filter support (in experimental) (#75 by @draconix6)
- Added f1 support (f1:true in SS can make the wall look "cleaner")
- Overhauled window management settings to give the user more power of the window behaviour
  - Window maximizing is now explicitly set by the user
  - Window position can now reference the center of the window
  - "Choose Monitor" will now use the new center position
  - Added "Fullscreen before Unpause" option to fix mouse issues when working with weird window sizes
- Reorganized some GUI stuff
- Various fixes

Changes in v0.21.4:
- Fixed a crash when Julti is placed in a path with spaces

Changes in v0.21.3:
- Fix some plugin loading stuff
- Check if `TheWall.ahk` is running and warn the user of the conflict
- Fixed some scene generation crashes in the OBS script
- Added session reset counter
    - Outputs to `sessionresets.txt` which is found in the `.Julti` folder (also where `resets.txt` is)
    - The command `sessionresets [num]` can be used to set the counter manually, in the case where you need to restart Julti or if Julti crashes.
- Profile options will now save every 100 resets (reset counter isn't just stored in `resets.txt`, it is stored in each profile as well)
    - This should mostly fix the issue of "my reset counter goes back by thousands"; Julti already saves the reset count when exiting, but clearly this doesn't fully work sometimes, so more saving has been added.

Changes in v0.21.2:
- Removed auto title setting after 5 seconds of inactivity
- Updated Plugin API
- Prevent a divide by 0 crash (probably still underlying issues with this)
- Fixed resetting window size on startup for fullscreen players
- Fixed spacing of texts and buttons on the Plugins menu

Changes in v0.21.1:
- Updated Standard Manager
    - Fixed reversed naming on render distance values

Changes in v0.21.0:
- Added plugins menu
- Added more plugin API
- Added Standard Manager as a default plugin

Changes in v0.20.1:
- Made the "Play Next Lock" and "Reset All" wall keys more compatible
- Added Plug-in API and Plug-in loading (Plug-in menu still needed)

Changes in v0.20.0:
Eventually there were too many changes to even keep track of, this list is certainly not complete.

Julti Functionality Changes in v0.20.0:
- Added Smart Switch: When enabled, attempts to switch to instances that are not yet loaded will be redirected to already locked and loaded instances if any exist.
- When suggesting to update, you can now automatically download and restart Julti without visiting the github page.

Option changes in v0.20.0:
- Dirt cover release % has been removed, world preview state output is reliable in v4.0.0, so there is only a checkbox for dirt covers now
- Wide Reset Squish has been replaced by multiple window size options (playing vs resetting window size)
- Pause on load option removed, worlds will pause on load by default now
- No cope mode removed
- "Clean wall" has been removed, clutters code and is problematic for too many people for not much benefit

OBS Script changes in v0.20.0:
- New verification scene generation for a single loading square due to world preview updates, and will also support multiple window sizes during resetting to improve verifiability of the "Unsquish on lock setting" (You will need to press generate scenes again to get this)
- Ability to have single instance scenes (`Playing 1`, `Playing 2`, etc...) (There are no scene generators for this yet)
- Checkbox to generate window captures on the Julti scene instead of game cap
- Checkbox to let verification scene share captures with Julti scene
- Checkbox to make dirt covers turn the instance invisible / tp it away to show a background image
- Checkbox to center active instances and show their actual size for a better viewing experience when using eye zoom macro
- A couple crash and error message fixes

Technical Changes in v0.20.0:
- Rewrote the core of Julti and copied most of the old code on top of it and then adjusted it to work with the new core (this was basically all of the work)
  - This means Julti should be more stable and consistent, including the bugs, so hopefully they are way more consistent and fixable.
  - Now uses the new world preview state output feature, meaning Julti can very easily determine what state an instance is in, leading to more stability and consistency
- Added affinity "jumping", which boosts the affinity of an instance that is about to be switched to, or boosts the affinity of instances that have been sent a reset input, making switching and resetting smoother. This is just a consistent optimization so there is no option for this.

Changes in v0.18.0:
- Added experimental features tab, which you can enable in the other options tab
  - This will let you access some hidden features from the GUI which you previously could only enable through the command line.
- Added new experimental feature: "Always On Top Projector"
  - This could help solve issues such as instances appearing on top of the wall while the wall is supposed to be focused. 

Changes in v0.17.2:
- Lots of bug fixes and changes for non-borderless users
- Removed F3 as a modifier key, allowing it to be used as a hotkey
- Add a warning for when a minecraft key in standard settings is badly formatted
- Fix scripts freezing when using a hotkey for a deleted script
- Fix launching instances with mismatching folder/name
- Added a warning to the "unsquish on lock" option since it may mess with verification
- Added a bunch of other warnings and errors to the log
- Better game version detection using MultiMC instance data rather than the window title of the game

Changes in v0.17.1:
- Massively sweeping code changes and refactors (thanks in part to @QuesiaSR)
- It turns out that for the past however many versions, julti has been using every reset method, meaning it has pressed the create new world key, leave preview key, and esc-shift-tab-enter to reset every instance every single time, so this has been fixed
- When instances are detected, they will now quickly activate and receive a click input, which fixes mouse teleports and not being able to reset from title screen

Changes in v0.17.0:
- Added Sounds (#5)
    - Settings are in the new Sound tab
    - Also added a playsound command
- Added the "Play Next Lock" hotkey, which will play the most loaded locked instance
- A fix for blazes and caves fix
- Several refactors and nerd stuff

Changes in v0.16.0:
- Completely rewritten OBS script and functionality (#45)
    - The lua script is now saved by Julti to your Documents folder and the .Julti folder
    - Only set names can be used, however everything can be set up with "Generate Scenes"
    - Everything is centered around the "Julti" scene
    - Sounds are automatically setup in the "Sounds" scene, and can be customized there
    - Locks are customized through changing the "Lock Display" scene
    - Dirt covers are customized through changing the "Dirt Cover Display" scene
    - Further "stream scenes" can be generated, and allow you to add some elements that you only want to appear while on the wall or only want to appear while playing an instance.
    - You can add borders to instances inside the OBS settings in the Julti App
    - The OBS setup for both regular wall and instance moving is the same

    - New scripts can be made and imported using the scripts menu accessed from the main GUI
    - Hotkeys can be bound to scripts in the hotkey settings (hotkey bindings are per profile, but the scripts themselves are global)
- Added Dynamic Wall (Instance Moving)
    - Features a smaller wall (default 2x2 or set to custom wall size in wall settings)
    - Locked instance go to the "lock bar" at the bottom of the screen, height of the lock bar can be customized in wall settings
- Added "Reset Instance Data" button to clear any data stored about the instances such as detected standard options or mods
- Added customizable affinity "burst" (#54)
- Added offline instance launching (#53)
- Added World Loaded Affinity

Changes in v0.15.0:
- **Removed fullscreen mode** due to it being too slow and jank. Fullscreen can still be used during runs by using Julti's fullscreen hotkey. Refer to v0.14.0 patch notes.
- Added support for instances that do not use the World Preview mod (will perhaps allow for stuff like pre-1.9 in the future) (#43)
- Added Pie Chart On Load option, which is illegal for normal runs and is meant for superflat runs (apparently) (#42)
